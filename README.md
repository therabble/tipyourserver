A place to make fundraising for COVID-19 impacted service workers easier. Our goal is to increase voluntary giving to service workers losing hours, jobs, and income fastest as COVID-19 requires us all to socially distance. The Virtual Tip Jar allows service workers to share paypal and venmo accounts and community members to tip workers directly via those accounts.

The Virtual Tip Jar started with the [Pittsburgh Virtual Tip Jar](http://centerforethicsandpolicy.com/PGHTipJar.html), created by Danielle Wenner at Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Ethics and Policy. Danielle made a Google form for service workers to list their PayPal and Venmo addresses in Pittsburg, [Philip C](https://github.com/wiscoDude) copied it to Madison and made copying it easier, [Cam Wiegart](https://github.com/camwiegert) created an API to Philip's Madison server spreadsheet, and tipyourserver.org/MSN is a front end [Glenn Loos-Austin](https://github.com/xretsim) built, calling a fork of Cam's API.

The Tip Your Server code is intended to make actually tipping easier, offering randomly selected people and adding Venmo and PayPal buttons. Its concept was suggested by many and is loosely based on something someone else did in Chattanooga. It also lets visitors pick a venue and see just the people who work(ed) there.
